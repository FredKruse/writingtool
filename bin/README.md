# WritingTool (based on LanguageTool)

The extension offers the following advantages over the use of internal LanguageTool in Libreoffice:
* The extension runs on the local machine. No remote server is needed.
* The extension supports all rules working on the level of full text (e.g., opening and closing quotes are recognized even if they are more than one paragraph away from each other).
* The extension uses the LanguageTool spell checker in addition to that of Libreoffice.
* The extension supports grammar checking of Impress and Calc documents (Only manual checking by the LT check dialog. An automated check is not supported by LibreOffice.)
* The extension offers a configuration dialog:
  * Easily activate / deactivate optional rules
  * Easily deactivate / reactivate default rules
  * Define custom colors and styles for rule groups or single rules
  * Change parameters for some special rules
  * Define profiles to check different kinds of documents
* The extension works with caching, which makes repeated work on long texts much easier.
* The extension offers the possibility of statistical analyses, such as frequently used words, filler words, etc. (for individual languages).
* Support of (local) AI (in progress)
